# VBA Challenge
### A homework assignment from the University of Birmingham Data Analytics Bootcamp (January 2022)

 - The aim of this project was to create a web visualisation dashboard for [a previous homework assignment](https://github.com/J-Fairgrieve/python-api-challenge/blob/main/WeatherPy.ipynb) using HTML & CSS
 - The site consists of a landing page, visualisation pages, comparison pages, data pages & a working navbar that reacts to the width of the page window
